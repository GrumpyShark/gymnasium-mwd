<h1>History</h1>

<p>The term Chakra appears to first emerge within the <cite>Vedas</cite>, the most authoritative Hindu text, though not precisely in the sense of psychic energy centers, rather as <i class="Sanskrit">chakravartin</i> or the king who "turns the wheel of his empire" in all directions from a center, representing his influence and power. The iconography popular in representing the Chakras, trace back to the five symbols of <i class="Sanskrit">yajna</i>, the Vedic fire altar: "square, circle, triangle, half moon and dumpling".</p>

<p>The hymn 10.136 of the <i class="Sanskrit">Rigveda</i> mentions a renunciate yogi with a female named <i class="Sanskrit">kunamnama</i>. Literally, it means "she who is bent, coiled", representing both a minor goddess and one of many embedded enigmas and esoteric riddles within the Rigveda. Some scholars, such as David Gordon White and Georg Feuerstein interpret this might be related to <i class="Sanskrit">kundalini shakti</i>, and an overt overature to the terms of esotericism that would later emerge in Post-Aryan Bramhanism. the Upanishad.</p>

<p>Breath channels (<i class="Sanskrit">nāḍi</i>) of Yoga practices are mentioned in the classical <cite>Upanishads of Hinduism</cite> dated to 1st millennium BCE, but not psychic-energy Chakra theories. The latter, states White, were introduced about 8th-century CE in Buddhist texts as hierarchies of inner energy centers, such as in the <i class="Sanskrit">Hevajra Tantra</i> and <i class="Sanskrit">Caryāgiti</i>. These are called by various terms such as <i class="Sanskrit">cakka, padma</i> (lotus) or <i class="Sanskrit">pitha</i> (mound). These medieval Buddhist texts mention only four chakras, while later Hindu texts such as the <i class="Sanskrit">Kubjikāmata</i> and <i class="Sanskrit">Kaulajñānanirnaya</i> expanded the list to many more.</p>

<p>In contrast to White, according to Feuerstein, early <cite>Upanishads of Hinduism</cite> do mention cakra in the sense of "psychospiritual vortices", along with other terms found in tantra: <b>prana</b> or <b>vayu</b> (life energy) along with <b>nadi</b> (energy carrying arteries). According to Galvin Flood, the ancient texts do not present chakra and kundalini-style yoga theories although these words appear in the earliest Vedic literature in many contexts. The chakra in the sense of four or more vital energy centers appear in the medieval era Hindu and Buddhist texts.</p>

<h1>Etymology</h1>

<p>The very concept of the so-called chakra, etymologically originates directly from the Sanskrit root <i class="Sanskrit">चक्र</i>. The "tsschakra" remained in virtual linguistic conformity throughout possible adaptations throughout the relative temporal and linguist adversity of two thousand years. At heart, the chakra denotes a "wheel", a "circle", and a "cycle". One of the Hindu scriptures, <cite>Rigveda</cite>, mentions Chakra with the meaning of "wheel", with <i class="Sanskrit">ara</i> (spokes). According to Frits Staal, Chakra has Indo-European roots, is "related to Greek Kuklos (from which comes English cycle), Latin circus, Anglo-Saxon hveohl and English wheel." However, the Vedic period texts use the same word as a simile in other contexts, such as the "wheel of time" or "wheel of dharma", such as in Rigveda hymn verse 1.164.11.</p>

<p>In Buddhism generally and Theravada specifically, the Pali noun <i class="Sanskrit">cakka</i> connotes "wheel". Within the central "Tripitaka", the Buddha variously references the "dhammacakka", or "wheel of dharma", connoting that his dharma, universal in its advocacy, should bear the marks which bear the very characteristic of any temporal dispensation. While further, it should be added that the Buddha himself insinuated freedom from cycles in and of themselves - <i class="latin">sui generis</i> - be they karmic, reincarnative, liberative, cognitive or emotional.</p>

<p>In Jainism, the term Chakra also means "wheel" and appears in various context in its ancient literature. Like other Indian religions, Chakra in esoteric theories in Jainism such as those by <cite>Buddhisagarsuri</cite> means yogic-energy centers.</p>
