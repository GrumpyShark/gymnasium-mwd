<h1>Classical traditions</h1>

<p>The classical eastern traditions, particularly those that developed in India during the 1st millennium AD, primarily describe <b>nadi</b> and <b>cakra</b> in a "subtle body" context. To them, they are the parallel dimension of psyche-mind reality that is invisible yet real. In the nadi and cakra flow the <b>prana</b> (breath, life energy). The concept of "life energy" varies between the texts, ranging from simple inhalation-exhalation to far more complex association with breath-mind-emotions-sexual energy. This essence is what vanishes when a person dies, leaving a gross body. Some of it, states this subtle body theory, is what withdraws within when one sleeps. All of it is believed to be reachable, awake-able and important for an individual's body-mind health, and how one relates to other people in one's life. This subtle body network of nadi and chakra is, according to some later Indian theories and many new age speculations, closely associated with emotions.</p>

<h2>Hindu Tantra</h2>

<p>Different esoteric traditions in Hinduism mention numerous numbers and arrangements chakras, of which a classical system of seven is most prevalent. This seven-part system, central to the core texts of <i class="Sanskrit">hatha yoga</i>, is one among many systems found in Hindu tantric literature. These texts teach many different Chakra theories.</p>

<p>The Chakra methodology is extensively developed in the goddess tradition of Hinduism called <i class="Sanskrit">Shaktism</i>. It is an important concept along with <i class="Sanskrit">yantras, mandalas</i> and <i class="Sanskrit">kundalini yoga</i> in its practice. Chakra in Shakta tantrism means circle, an "energy center" within, as well as being a term of group rituals such as in <i class="Sanskrit">chakra-puja</i> (worship within a circle) which may or may not involve tantra practice. The cakra-based system is one part of the meditative exercises that came to be known as <i class="Sanskrit">laya yoga</i>.</p>

<p>Beyond its original Shakta milieu, various sub-traditions within the <i class="Sanskrit">Shaiva</i> and <i class="Sanskrit">Vaishnava</i> schools of Hinduism also developed texts and practices on Nadi and Chakra systems. Certain modern Hindu groups also utilize a technique of circular energy work based on the chakras known as <i class="Sanskrit">kriya yoga</i>. Followers of this practice include the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bihar_School_of_Yoga">Bihar School of Yoga</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self_Realization_Fellowship">Self Realization Fellowship</a>, and practitioners are known as <i class="Sanskrit">kriyaban</i>. Although Paramahansa Yogananda claimed this was the same technique taught as kriya yoga by Patañjali in the <cite>Yoga Sūtras</cite> and by Krishna in the <cite>Bhagavad Gita</cite> (as karma yoga), Swami Satyananda of the Bihar school disagreed with this assessment and acknowledged the similarities between kriya and taoist inner orbit practices. Both schools claim the technique is taught in every age by an avatar of god known as <b>Babaji</b>. The historicity of its techniques in India prior to the early twentieth century are not well established. It believed by its practitioners to activate the chakras and stimulate faster spiritual development.</p>

<h2>Buddhist Tantra</h2>

<p>The esoteric traditions in Buddhism generally teach five chakras. It must be noted, it is possible that a system of <b>Manipura, Anahata, Visuddha</b> and the <b>Usnisa Kamala</b> chakras was absorbed into Tibetan thought, yet any source which alleges the employment of 3rd or manipura, chakra, within the context of a thousand year history of broad Tantric monasticism, is here, not only conceptually inadequate, but technically misguided. In one development within the <i class="chinese">Nyingma</i> lineage of the <cite>Mantrayana of Tibetan Buddhism</cite> a popular conceptualization of chakras in increasing subtlety and increasing order is as follows: <b>Nirmanakaya</b> (gross self), <b>Sambhogakaya</b> (subtle self), <b>Dharmakaya</b> (causal self), and <b>Mahasukhakaya</b> (non-dual self), each vaguely - yet by no means directly - corresponding to the categories within the <i class="chinese">Shaiva Mantramarga</i> universe, i.e., Svadhisthana, Anahata, Visuddha, Sahasrara, etc. However, depending on the meditational tradition, these vary between three and six.</p>

<p><em>Chakras clearly play a key role in Tibetan Buddhism, and are considered to be the pivotal providence of Tantric thinking.</em> And, the precise use of the chakras across the gamete of tantric sadhanas gives little space to doubt the primary efficacy of Tibetan Buddhism as distinct religious agency, that being that precise revelation that, without Tantra there would be no Chakras, but more importantly, <em>without Chakras, there is no Tibetan Buddhism</em>. The highest practices in Tibetan Buddhism point to the ability to bring the subtle pranas of an entity into alignment with the central channel, and to thus penetrate the realisation of the ultimate unity, namely, the "organic harmony" of one's individual consciousness of Wisdom with the co-attainment of All-embracing Love, thus synthesizing a direct cognition of absolute Buddhahood.</p>

<p>According to Geoffrey Samuel, the buddhist esoteric systems developed <i class="Sanskrit">cakra</i> and <i class="Sanskrit">nadi</i> as "central to their soteriological process". The theories were sometimes, but not always, coupled with a unique system of physical exercises, called <i class="Sanskrit">yantra yoga</i> or <i class="Sanskrit">'phrul 'khor</i>.</p>

<p>The Chakras in the Tibetan practice are considered psycho-spiritual constituents, each bearing meaningful correspondences to cosmic processes and their postulated buddha counterpart.</p>

<p>Chakras, according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bon">Bon</a> tradition, ennable the gestalt of experience, with each of the five major chakras, being psychologically linked with the five experiential qualities of unenlightened consciousness, the six realms of woe.</p>

<p>The <i class="chinese">tsa lung</i> practice embodied in the <i class="chinese">Trul khor</i> lineage, unbaffles the primary channels, thus activating and circulating liberating prana. <em>Yoga awakens the deep mind, thus bringing forth positive attributes, inherent gestalts, and virtuous qualities.</em> In a computer analogy, the screen of one's consciousness is slated and an attribute-bearing file is called up that contains necessary positive or negative, supportive qualities.</p>

<p>Tantric practice is said to eventually transform all experience into clear light. The practice aims to liberate from all negative conditioning, and the deep cognitive salvation of freedom from control and unity of perception and cognition.</p>

<h2>Qigong</h2>

<p><b>Qigong</b> (<i class="chinese">氣功</i>) also relies on a similar model of the human body as an esoteric energy system, except that it involves the circulation of <i class="chinese">qì (氣, also ki)</i> or life-energy. The qì, equivalent to the Hindu prana, flows through the energy channels called meridians, equivalent to the nadi, but two other energies are also important: <i class="chinese">jīng</i>, or primordial essence, and <i class="chinese">shén</i>, or spirit energy.</p>

<p>In the principle circuit of qì, called the microcosmic orbit, energy rises up a main meridian along the spine, but also comes back down the front torso. Throughout its cycle it enters various <b>dantian</b> (elixir fields) which act as furnaces, where the types of energy in the body (jing, qi and shen) are progressively refined. These dantian play a very similar role to that of chakras. The number of dantian varies depending on the system; the navel dantian is the most well-known, but there is usually a dantian located at the heart and between the eyebrows. The lower dantian at or below the navel transforms essence, or jīng, into qì. The middle dantian in the middle of the chest transforms qì into shén, or spirit, and the higher dantian at the level of the forehead (or at the top of the head), transforms shen into <i class="chinese">wuji</i>, infinite space of void.</p>

<h2>Silat</h2>

<p>Traditional spirituality in the Malay Archipelago borrows heavily from Hindu-Buddhist concepts. In Malay and Indonesian metaphysical theory, the chakras' energy rotates outwards along diagonal lines. Defensive energy emits outwards from the centre line, while offensive energy moves inwards from the sides of the body. This can be applied to energy-healing, meditation, or martial arts. Silat practitioners learn to harmonise their movements with the chakras, thereby increasing the power and effectiveness of attacks and movements.</p>
