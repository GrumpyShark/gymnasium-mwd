<p><i class="Sanskrit">Chakras</i> are the various focal points in the subtle body used in a variety of ancient meditation practices, collectively denominated as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tantra">Tantra</a>, or the esoteric or inner traditions of Indian religion, Chinese Taoism, Tibetan Buddhism, as well as Japanese Esoteric Buddhism, and in postmodernity, in new age medicine, and originally psychologically adopted to the western mind through the assistance of Carl Jung.</p>

<p>The concept is found in the early traditions of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism">Hinduism</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism">Buddhism</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism">Jainism</a>. They are treated as focal points, or putative nodes in the subtle body of the practitioner. These theories differ between the Indian religions, with many esoteric Buddhist texts consistently mentioning <em>five</em> Chakras, while separate esoteric Hindu sources will offer <em>six</em>, or even <em>seven</em>. They are believed to be embedded within the actual physical body, whilst also originating within the context of mental and spiritual fields, or complexes of electromagnetic variety, the precise degree and variety of which directly arise from a synthetic average of all positive and negative so-called "fields", this eventuating the complex <i class="Sanskrit">Nadi</i>. Within <i class="Sanskrit">kundalini yoga </i>breath exercises, visualizations, <i>mudras, bandhas, kriyas</i>, and <i class="Sanskrit">mantras</i> are focused on transmuting subtle energy through "chakras".</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Chakra is a part of the esoteric medieval era theories about physiology and psychic centers that emerged across Indian traditions. The theory posited that human life simultaneously exists in two parallel dimensions, one "physical body" (sthula sarira) and other "psychological, emotional, mind, non-physical" it is called the "subtle body" (suksma sarira).This subtle body is energy, while the physical body is mass. The psyche or mind plane corresponds to and interacts with the body plane, and the theory posits that the body and the mind mutually affect each other. The subtle body consists of <i class="Sanskrit">nadi</i> (energy channels) connected by nodes of psychic energy it called chakra. The theory grew into extensive elaboration, with some suggesting 88,000 chakras throughout the subtle body. The chakra it considered most important varied between various traditions, but they typically ranged between four and seven.</p>

<figcap><p>The seven Chakras are arranged along the spinal cord, from bottom to top: 
	<ol>
	<li>Muladhara</li> 
	<li>Svadhisthana</li>
	<li>Nabhi-Manipura</li>

	<li>Vishuddhi</li> 
	<li>Ajna</li> 
	<li>Sahasrara</li>

</p></figcap>

<p>The important chakras are stated in Buddhist and Hindu texts to be arranged in a column along the spinal cord, from its base to the top of the head, connected by vertical channels. The tantric traditions sought to master them, awaken and energize them through various breathing exercises or with assistance of a teacher. These chakras were also symbolically mapped to specific human physiological capacity, seed syllables (<i class="Sanskrit">bija</i>), sounds, subtle elements (<i class="Sanskrit">tanmatra</i>), in some cases deities, colors and other motifs.</p>

<p>The chakra theories of Buddhism and Hinduism differs from the historic Chinese system of meridians in acupuncture. Unlike the latter, the chakra relates to subtle body, wherein it has a position but no definite nervous node or precise physical connection. The tantric systems envision it as a continually present, highly relevant and a means to psychic and emotional energy. It is useful in a type of yogic rituals and meditative discovery of radiant inner energy (prana flows) and mind-body connections. The meditation is aided by extensive symbology, mantras, diagrams, models (deity and mandala). The practitioner proceeds step by step from perceptible models, to increasingly abstract models where deity and external mandala are abandoned, inner self and internal mandalas are awakened.</p>

<p>These ideas are not unique to Buddhist and Hindu traditions. Similar and overlapping concepts emerged in other cultures in the East and the West, and these are variously called by other names such as subtle body, spirit body, esoteric anatomy, sidereal body and etheric body. According to Geoffrey Samuel and Jay Johnston, professors of Religious studies known for their studies on Yoga and esoteric traditions:<p/>

<blockquote>
<p>Ideas and practices involving so-called 'subtle bodies' have existed for many centuries in many parts of the world. (...) Virtually all human cultures known to us have some kind of concept of mind, spirit or soul as distinct from the physical body, if only to explain experiences such as sleep and dreaming. (...) An important subset of subtle-body practices, found particularly in Indian and Tibetan Tantric traditions, and in similar Chinese practices, involves the idea of an internal 'subtle physiology' of the body (or rather of the body-mind complex) made up of channels through which substances of some kind flow, and points of intersection at which these channels come together. In the Indian tradition the channels are known as nadi and the points of intersection as cakra.</p>

<cite>— Geoffrey Samuel and Jay Johnston, Religion and the Subtle Body in Asia and the West: Between Mind and Body</cite> 
</blockquote>

<h3>Contrast with classical yoga</h3>


<p>Chakra and related theories have been important to the esoteric traditions, <em>but they are not directly related to mainstream yoga.</em> According to Edwin Bryant and other scholars, the goals of classical yoga such as spiritual liberation (freedom, self-knowledge, moksha) is "attained entirely differently in classical yoga, and the cakra / nadi / kundalini physiology is completely peripheral to it."</p>

<p>The more common and most studied esoteric system incorporates six major chakras along with a seventh center generally not regarded as a chakra. These points are arranged vertically along the axial channel (<i>sushumna nadi</i> in Hindu texts, <i>Avadhuti</i> in some Buddhist texts). It was this chakra system that was translated in early 20th century by Sir John Woodroffe (also called Arthur Avalon) in the text <cite>The Serpent Power</cite>. Avalon translated the Hindu text <cite>Ṣaṭ-Cakra-Nirūpaṇa</cite> meaning the examination (nirūpaṇa) of the six (ṣaṭ) chakras (cakra).</p>

<p>The Chakras are traditionally considered meditation aids. The yogi progresses from lower chakras to the highest chakra blossoming in the crown of the head, internalizing the journey of spiritual ascent. In both the Hindu and Buddhist kundalini or candali traditions, the chakras are pierced by a dormant energy residing near or in the lowest chakra. In Hindu texts she is known as Kundalini, while in Buddhist texts she is called Candali or Tummo (Tibetan: gtum mo, "fierce one").</p>

<p>Below are the common new age description of these six chakras and the seventh point known as <i class="Sanskrit">sahasrara</i>. This new age version incorporates the newtonian colors that were completely unknown when these systems were created. The actual colors for the chakras vary from text to text and do not conform to the newtonian spectrum:</p>

<td><p><b>Sahasrara</b> (Sanskrit: सहस्रार, IAST: Sahasrāra, English: "thousand-petaled") or crown chakra is the topmost chakra in the subtle body, located in the crown of the head. In esoteric Hinduism and New Age western systems, it is generally considered to be the highest spiritual center and the state of pure consciousness, within which there is neither object nor subject. When the feminine <i class="Sanskrit">Kundalini Shakti</i> rises to this point, it unites with the masculine <i class="Sanskrit">Shiva</i>, the yogi or yogini achieves self-realization and a state of liberating <i class="Sanskrit">samadhi</i> is attained. The chakra is symbolized by a lotus with one thousand multi-coloured petals.</p>

<p>In esoteric Buddhism, it is called <i class="Sanskrit">Mahasukha</i> and is generally considered to be the petal lotus of "Great Bliss" and corresponding to the fourth state of Four Noble Truths.</p> </td></tr>

It is so called because this is the spot where the <i class="Sanskrit">tantra guru</i> touches the seeker during the initiation ritual (<i class="Sanskrit">saktipata</i>). He or she commands the awakened kundalini to pass through this center.</p>

<p>It is symbolised by a lotus with two petals.

It is symbolised by a lotus with twelve petals. Within it is a <i class="Sanskrit">yantra</i> of two intersecting triangles, forming a hexagram, symbolising a union of the male and female as well as being the esoteric symbol for the element of air (<i class="Sanskrit">vayu</i>).
