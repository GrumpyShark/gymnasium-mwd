<h1>Reception and similar theories in the West</h1>

In 1918, the translation of two Indian texts: the <cite>Ṣaṭ-Cakra-Nirūpaṇa</cite> and the <cite>Pādukā-Pañcaka</cite>, by Sir John Woodroffe, alias Arthur Avalon, in a book titled <cite>The Serpent Power</cite> introduced the <i class="sa">shakta</i> theory of seven main chakras in the West. This book is extremely detailed and complex, and later the ideas were developed into the predominant Western view of the chakras by C. W. Leadbeater in his book <cite>The Chakras</cite>. Many of the views which directed Leadbeater's understanding of the chakras were influenced by previous theosophist authors, in particular Johann Georg Gichtel, a disciple of Jakob Böhme, and his book <cite>Theosophia Practica (1696)</cite>, in which Gichtel directly refers to inner force centres, a concept reminiscent of the chakras.

<h2>Hesychasm</h2>

<p>A completely separate contemplative movement within the Eastern Orthodox Church is Hesychasm, a form of Christian meditation. Comparisons have been made between the Hesychastic centres of prayer and the position of the chakras. Particular emphasis is placed upon the heart area. However, there is no talk about these centres as having any sort of metaphysical existence. Far more than in any of the cases discussed above, the centres are simply places to focus the concentration during prayer.</p>

<h2>New Age</h2>

<p>In <cite>Anatomy of the Spirit (1996)</cite>, Caroline Myss describes the function of chakras as follows: 
"Every thought and experience you've ever had in your life gets filtered through these chakra databases. Each event is recorded into your cells...". The chakras are described as being aligned in an ascending column from the base of the spine to the top of the head. New Age practices often associates each chakra with a certain colour. In various traditions, chakras are associated with multiple physiological functions, an aspect of consciousness, a classical element, and other distinguishing characteristics. They are visualised as lotuses or flowers with a different number of petals in every chakra.</p>

<p>The chakras are thought to vitalise the physical body and to be associated with interactions of a physical, emotional and mental nature. They are considered loci of life energy or <i class="sa">prana</i> (which New Age belief equates with <i>shakti</i>, <i>qi</i> in Chinese, <i>ki</i> in Japanese, <i>koach-ha-guf</i> in Hebrew, <i>bios</i> in Greek, and <i>aether</i> in both Greek and English), which is thought to flow among them along pathways called <i class="sa">nadi</i>. The function of the chakras is to spin and draw in this energy to keep the spiritual, mental, emotional and physical health of the body in balance.</p>

<p>Rudolf Steiner considered the chakra system to be dynamic and evolving. He suggested that this system has become different for modern people than it was in ancient times and that it will, in turn, be radically different in future times. Steiner described a sequence of development that begins with the upper chakras and moves down, rather than moving in the opposite direction. He gave suggestions on how to develop the chakras through disciplining thoughts, feelings, and will.</p>

<p>According to Florin Lowndes, a "spiritual student" can further develop and deepen or elevate thinking consciousness when taking the step from the "ancient path" of schooling to the "new path" represented by Steiner's <cite>The Philosophy of Freedom</cite>.</p>

<h2>Endocrine system</h2>

<p>Chakras and their importance are posited to reside in the psyche. However, there are those who believe that chakras have a physical manifestation as well. Gary Osborn, for instance, has described the chakras as metaphysical counterparts to the endocrine glands, while Anodea Judith noted a marked similarity between the positions of the two and the roles described for each. Stephen Sturgess also links the lower six chakras to specific nerve plexuses along the spinal cord as well as glands. C.W. Leadbeater associated the <b>Ajna</b> chakra with the pineal gland, which is a part of the endocrine system. These associations remain speculative, however, and have no empirical validation.</p>
